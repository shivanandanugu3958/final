            <h2>WHAT IS OUR MISSION?</h2>
            <p>
                Breakthrough Manchester College-Bound at SNHU (BTM-CB) is a tuition-free program guided by a mission to give continued support in academic growth, educational enrichment, college-readiness, and essential skill-building to highly motivated, under-resourced high school students while inspiring the next generation of well-rounded leaders and educators.
            </p>
            <p>
                BTM-CB continues the college-access pipeline for students who entered the program as rising 7th graders through Breakthrough Manchester at the Derryfield School. BTM-CB seeks to complete its mission through dedicated advising and support of students, college access and success curriculum on eight College-Bound Saturdays, and a college success culture and community.

            <h2>WHAT ARE OUR CORE VALUES?</h2>
            <p>
                In the College-Bound program at Breakthrough Manchester, we are dedicated to helping motivated students grow into 6C Learners. Based on the models of leading minds in education such as Michael Fullan, a worldwide authority on educational reform, the 6C Learner is a well-rounded leader focused on growing and building skills in the following six areas:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CHARACTER:</strong> 6C Learners build their character education by being resilient, responsible, empathetic, and confident. They take time to focus on their own well-being and balance in addition to supporting the well-being and balance of others. They seize opportunities and thrive in challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>CITIZENSHIP:</strong> 6C Learners actively participate as citizens of their community by treating others with dignity and respect, building their global and cultural knowledge base, and advancing environmental awareness. They don’t just take from the community; they work at giving back.</li>
                <li><strong>COMMUNICATION:</strong> 6C Learners know that clear and consistent communication with their peers, supervisors, and community is absolutely essential for success. They are dedicated to building strong communication skills in the areas of speaking, listening, writing, and reading in a variety of contexts.</li>
                <li><strong>CRITICAL-THINKING:</strong> 6C Learners do not just solve problems, they self-direct to design and manage creative solutions. They use their knowledge base, community, and various tools and resources to seek out barriers and break through them.</li>
                <li><strong>COLLABORATION:</strong> 6C Learners recognize that together they are stronger. They learn from each other, use their unique skills to complement other members of the team, and work together to overcome challenges. They share each other’s burdens as well as successes.</li>
                <li><strong>CREATIVITY:</strong> 6C Learners are innovative entrepreneurs and leaders. They harness the power of imagination to solve problems and meet challenges. They seize every moment and remember to play and have fun!
